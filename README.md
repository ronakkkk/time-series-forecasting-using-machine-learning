# time-series-forecasting-using-machine-learning
-> Developed a forecasting model using four classification models.

-> The forecasting is done on cases and deaths for the next 45 days based on the global cases and deaths caused by the
covid 19 virus.

-> Accuracy: Gradient Regression– 86.2%, DTC– 84.5%, Linear Regression– 81.1%, Fbprophet– 92.8%.

-> Technologies used: Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn, Fbprophet, DTC, Linear Regression,
Gradient Regression.
